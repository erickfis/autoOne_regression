AutoOne Price Prediction
========================

AutoOne is a fictional company which buys and sells used cars in more than 30 countries across Europe.

The heart of their business is to chose prices for buying and selling cars while making a profit.

They have lots of information on car sales and they want to be able to make data driven decisions when deciding what are the best prices.

Therefore, in this exercise we will use the data available to build a statistical model for predicting prices for a given car.

We will address data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, linear regression and machine learning algorithms.
